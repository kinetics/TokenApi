# TokenApi

This is the start of the token based api we will be using in the 3 part meetup series.

In part one we discussed web tokens, logins, registration, validation, and some basic Oauth concepts. In the next part, we will 
make this api more robust, with token blacklisting, forgot password mechanics, account recovery mechanics, and oauth compliance. 

We will build on what has been scaffolded here so far.
